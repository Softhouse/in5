# -----------------------------
# Helper Functions

# Get the prepared site/document title
# Often we would like to specify particular formatting to our page's title
# we can apply that formatting here
    getPreparedTitle: ->
# if we have a document title, then we should use that and suffix the site's title onto it
      if @document.title
        "#{@document.title} | #{@site.title}"
# if our document does not have it's own title, then we should just use the site's title
      else
        @site.title

# Get the prepared site/document description
    getPreparedDescription: ->
# if we have a document description, then we should use that, otherwise use the site's description
      @document.description or @site.description

# Get the prepared site/document keywords
    getPreparedKeywords: ->
# Merge the document keywords with the site keywords
      @site.keywords.concat(@document.keywords or []).join(', ')

    getCuttedContent: (content) ->
      i = content.search('<!-- br -->')
      if i >= 0
        content[0..i-1] + "..."
      else
        content

    hasReadMore: (content) ->
      content.search('<!-- br -->') >= 0

# =================================
# Collections

# Here we define our custom collections
# What we do is we use findAllLive to find a subset of documents from the parent collection
# creating a live collection out of it
# A live collection is a collection that constantly stays up to date
# You can learn more about live collections and querying via
# http://bevry.me/queryengine/guide

  collections:

# Create a collection called posts
# That contains all the documents that will be going to the out path posts
    books: ->
      @getCollection("html").findAllLive({ layout:"book"})

    featured: ->
      @getCollection("html").findAllLive({ featured: true})


# =================================
# Environments

# DocPad's default environment is the production environment
# The development environment, actually extends from the production environment

# The following overrides our production url in our development environment with false
# This allows DocPad's to use it's own calculated site URL instead, due to the falsey value
# This allows <%- @site.url %> in our template data to work correctly, regardless what environment we are in

  environments:
    development:
      templateData:
        site:
          url: false


# =================================
# DocPad Events

# Here we can define handlers for events that DocPad fires
# You can find a full listing of events on the DocPad Wiki

  events:

# Server Extend
# Used to add our own custom routes to the server before the docpad routes are added
    serverExtend: (opts) ->
# Extract the server from the options
      {server} = opts
      docpad = @docpad

      # As we are now running in an event,
      # ensure we are using the latest copy of the docpad configuraiton
      # and fetch our urls from it
      latestConfig = docpad.getConfig()
      oldUrls = latestConfig.templateData.site.oldUrls or []
      newUrl = latestConfig.templateData.site.url

      # Redirect any requests accessing one of our sites oldUrls to the new site url
      server.use (req,res,next) ->
        if req.headers.host in oldUrls
          res.redirect(newUrl+req.url, 301)
        else
          next()
